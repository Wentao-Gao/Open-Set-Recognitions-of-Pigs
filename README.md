the pdf file and the mind map note will be given

## Week 2:  Then start reading papers and start writing research proposal

This week I have contact my tutor and get some help from him. Start with reading and writing rp. Also remenber to imporve programming skills with the official examples in [keras](https://keras.io/examples/).
