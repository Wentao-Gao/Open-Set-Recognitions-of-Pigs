# [Think Different](https://gwt9970161.github.io/Great-Project-/)
This is the project of my master's dissertation progress

Related course [intro to AI](https://gwt9970161.github.io/Introduction-to-AI/) can be helpful for the program

## Week 1:  A start of project

The first step is to do the reading of a related paper :
[*Visual identification of individual Holstein-Friesian cattle via deep metric learning*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/1.%20Visual%20identification%20of%20individual%20Holstein-Friesian%20cattle%20via%20deep%20metric%20learning.pdf)

the pdf file and the mind map note will be given

## Week 2:  Then start reading papers and start writing research proposal

This week I have contact my tutor and get some help from him. Start with reading and writing rp. Also remenber to imporve programming skills with the official examples in [keras](https://keras.io/examples/).

Date: 2022/02/24
reading: [*Recent Advances in Open Set Recognition- A Survey* ](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/2.%20Recent%20Advances%20in%20Open%20Set%20Recognition-%20A%20%20Survey.pdf)

in the progress of reading papers, some concept are vital for me to understanding first.
So I make some notes on CNN and SVM.

CNN: [*Convolutional Neural Network*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/%E5%8D%B7%E7%A7%AF%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3.md)

SVM: [*Support Vector Machine*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E5%90%91%E9%87%8F%E6%9C%BA.md)

These two file can help understand the concept. More details will be added.

The research proposal is quite important.The overall content is shown below.

|  Part | Content | 
| ----- | ------- | 
| Aims and Objectives | define the scope of your project |
| Motivation | establish the need for your project | 
| Literature Review | evaluate the relevant state-of-the-art | 
| Impact Assessment | consider potential social, environmental, economic, political, legal or  ethical implications | 
| Risk Register | identify and manage programmatic risks | 
| Timeline | a chart dividing your project into a set of subtasks with time allocations | 

[Aims and Objectives](https://patthomson.net/2014/06/09/aims-and-objectives-whats-the-difference/) : Limit of Machine Learning and Potencial of Open-set Recognition.

[Motivation](read://https_www.bloodraynebetrayal.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloodraynebetrayal.com%2Fsuzanna-escobar%2Fhow-to-write-better%2Fwhat-is-the-motivation-in-research%2F): Still thinking

[Literature Review](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/literature-review/) : Recognition of pigs / Object detection / Open-set Recognition

Impact Assessment : No idea

[Risk Register](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/project-risk-registers#:~:text=Example%201%3A%20%20%20Risk%20identifier%20%20,%20%20Low%20%20%20Project%20sponsor%20) : Still thinking

Timeline: Using gantt graph in Typora to build.

Also, I am going to study the tensorflow and keras to prepare for my dissertation.
