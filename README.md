# [Great-Project-](https://gwt9970161.github.io/Great-Project-/)
This is the project of my master's dissertation progress


## Week 1:  A start of project

The first step is to do the reading of a related paper :
[*Visual identification of individual Holstein-Friesian cattle via deep metric learning*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/1.%20Visual%20identification%20of%20individual%20Holstein-Friesian%20cattle%20via%20deep%20metric%20learning.pdf)

the pdf file and the mind map note will be given

## Week 2:  Then start reading papers and start writing research proposal

This week I have contact my tutor and get some help from him. Start with reading and writing rp. Also remenber to imporve programming skills with the official examples in [keras](https://keras.io/examples/).

Date: 2022/02/24
reading: [*Recent Advances in Open Set Recognition- A Survey* ](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/2.%20Recent%20Advances%20in%20Open%20Set%20Recognition-%20A%20%20Survey.pdf)

in the progress of reading papers, some concept are vital for me to understanding first.
So I make some notes on CNN and SVM.

CNN: [*Convolutional Neural Network*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/%E5%8D%B7%E7%A7%AF%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3.md)

SVM: [*Support Vector Machine*](https://github.com/gwt9970161/Great-Project-/blob/main/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E5%90%91%E9%87%8F%E6%9C%BA.md)

These two file can help understand the concept. More details will be added.

The research proposal is quite important.The overall plan is shown below.

|  Part | Content |
| ----- | ------- |
| Aims and Objectives | define the scope of your project |
| Motivation | establish the need for your project|
| Literature Review | evaluate the relevant state-of-the-art |
| Impact Assessment | consider potential social, environmental, economic, political, legal or  ethical implications |
| Risk Register | identify and manage programmatic risks |
| Timeline | a chart dividing your project into a set of subtasks with time allocations |
